This is a repository for p4 research
## source routing
	This is a simple demo model for p4 development framework test, which is based on simple_nat in /examples/simple_nat and demo1 in p4guide repo.
	The topo is similar to simple_nat.
	The p4 source comes from demo1.
	The table entries is based on the topo with the help of demo1
	sengip.py and recvip.py will run on h1 and h2.
	Maybe I should disable ipv6 like what source_routing and simple_nat dofor unknown ipv6 packets.
